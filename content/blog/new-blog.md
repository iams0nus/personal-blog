## About This Kashmiri Alu Dom

**Spicy and delish is this Kashmiri Alu Dom** where baby potatoes are simmered (dom cooked) in a spicy curd (yogurt) based gravy or sauce. This is a delicious recipe from the Kashmiri cuisine.

Out of all the recipes I make with baby potatoes, Kashmiri dum aloo is the most repeated one. The reason being it is easy and I just need to prepare rice and a side veggie dish or salad by the side.

This recipe was first adapted by me from a small palm sized cookbook having many Kashmiri recipes. After that, I have made this recipe many times and it is always a winner. Some key points below.

1. **Flavors:** This recipe of Kashmiri dum aloo is more like the way the actual Kashmiri dum aloo is – sour and spicy. The gravy or sauce does not taste like the ones you get in the restaurants – which is a creamy, sweet gravy made with onion & tomatoes.
2. **No onion no garlic:** the recipe does not have any onion or garlic in it. So this is a satvik recipe.
3. **Baby potatoes**: baby potatoes are parboiled and then fried. Later these fried baby potatoes are added in the gravy or sauce and slow simmered. The baby potatoes absorb the flavors of the spices and curd while cooking.
4. **Saving time:** when I am short of time, I fry the potatoes directly in oil or steam them completely till done. When I have time, I parboil the potatoes and then saute or pan fry till golden. You can choose any option you want.
5. **Red chilli powder:**  In the recipe I highly recommend to add Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch as they are not very hot or pungent and give a nice red color to the final dish. I have also made this Kashmiri dum aloo with a few varieties of red chilli powder and they made the dish too spicy. If you cannot handle the heat, then reduce the amount of the Kashmiri red chilli powder.
6. **Other spices:** This traditional recipe has spices like Kashmiri red chilli powder, ginger powder, fennel powder which are aromatic and combine to give a lovely warm flavor to the whole dish.
